To fix this, use the `getItemLayout` prop of the FlatList. This prop allows you to provide a function that pre-calculates the size of each item. This prevents the FlatList from having to re-measure items during rendering, which is a major cause of the layout issues.  Here's an example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={renderItem}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  getItemLayout={(data, index) => ({
    length: 50, // Fixed height of each item
    offset: 50 * index, // Offset of each item
    index,
  })}
/>
```

You will need to adjust the `length` and `offset` values to match the actual height of your items.  If your items have variable heights, you'll need a more sophisticated approach to calculate these values, potentially involving measuring the item height beforehand.
