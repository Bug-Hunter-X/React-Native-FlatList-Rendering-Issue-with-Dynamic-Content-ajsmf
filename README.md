This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with dynamic content that changes the size of list items. The `BuggyFlatList.js` file showcases the issue where a dynamic style calculation causes incorrect rendering. The solution in `FixedFlatList.js` provides a fix using `getItemLayout` to pre-calculate item heights and avoid the layout issues.
